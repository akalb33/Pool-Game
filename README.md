# Pool
By Andrew Kalb

Developed around 2020 with some help from my father. 

This is a rudementary pool game that has little to no ingame rules because it is meant to be played between 2 people.

The controls are relatively simple: rotate the mouse in a circular pattern to move the cue stick around the ball.

Then, the cue ball can be hit by holding left click, and moving the mouse parallel to the direction of the cue stick to pull back/hit the cue ball.

The cue ball can be picked up in the case of a scratch by holding space and moving the mouse.

HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:
 - Download the folder named "Pool" and launch the executable (Pool.exe) inside.

To run this program inside of Visual Studio Community, the SFML library will be required.
